Hello!

I'm a software developer.

You may find several different types of projects here. Some of it is for building a portfolio for potential employment. Others are personal projects to either take care of a need I have, or to fulfill a function that I feel is missing. You will often find these in Discord bots or websites I build should I put them here.

If you stumble across code here, please don't judge too harshly. I'm not a complete newbie, but I feel like it a lot and still feel I have a lot to learn. So when I put something up here for anyone to see, while I appreciate any help or suggestions offered, I'm not looking for antagonism. All I'm looking for is a safe place to share my code.

Please feel free to reach out if needed.
